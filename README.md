# enigma
### Self Evaluation

## Functionality - 3
Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt methods and command line interfaces successfully implemented.

## Object Oriented Programming - 3
Consists of at least 4 classes with single responsibilities (for the most part). Only 2 methods are longer than 7 lines and no class is longer than 100 lines.

## Test Driven Development - 2.5
Methods are tested, some mocks and stubs were used but were added later. Test coverage is at 99%.

## Version Control - 2.5
Slightly under 30 commits/10 pull requests with some commits containing multiple pieces of functionality. Need to improve with commits and pull requests.
